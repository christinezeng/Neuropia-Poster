# Neuropia - an Educational Neuron Simulation Platform

## Abstract
While there is much research on how neurons and neural networks communicate, an effective neuroscience tool to simulate this communication does not yet exist. Neuropia, the educational software Omar Lab is developing using JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, and Neuron, strives to solve this issue, creating accessible neuron interaction simulations for University of Michigan’s Neuroscience and Psychology students and those interested in learning Neuroscience. Implementation and improvements for Neuropia include:
1. 3D visualizations and integration of low-rheobase(LR) & regular spiking(RS) neurons in the retrosplenial cortex, a brain region critical for memory, learning, and navigation, and fast spiking(FS) neurons
2. new LR and RS simulation using experimental data gathered from the Omar Lab allow the user to modify the neuron inputs and view graphs of resulting neuron interaction in real time
3. greater accessibility and streamlined interface to the educational program’s design
